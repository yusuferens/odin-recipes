<p><i>If you crave a good iced coffee in the summer, but loathe the way so many end up tasting watery or overly bitter, then there's only one solution: cold brew coffee. This method guarantees a smooth and icy cup, every time.

    Making cold brew coffee is no great secret, nor does it require the ninja-level skills of a trained barista in order to master. You don't even need much special equipment beyond a large container for making the coffee and a strainer.
