    <p><i>Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it is so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time. While you wait for the dough to be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh vegetables, or grating the cheese you’ll put on top. Bake for 15 minutes, garnish with basil (or, let’s be real, more cheese), and enjoy showing off your way-better-than-takeout creation.</i></p>
    <p class="para">Dough:</p>
    <div class="ingredients">

            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>

            <li>3/4 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
            <li>1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons cold water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Combine flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a food processor and process until combined, about 3 seconds. With the processor running, slowly pour cold water and oil through the food chute and process until the dough forms a sticky ball that clears the sides of the bowl, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Lightly oil a work surface and set the dough ball on top; knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Shape the dough into a tight ball and place it in a large bowl greased with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Place a pizza stone on the lowest rack in the oven.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and gently reshape it into a ball. Coat the dough ball lightly with flour and flatten it into an 8-inch disk using your fingertips. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 12-inch circle, dusting the dough lightly with flour as needed. Dust a pizza peel with cornmeal and transfer the dough circle on top. Spread marinara sauce on the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. Bake until the edges are golden brown and the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and enjoy your delicious pizza!</li>
