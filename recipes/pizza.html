    <p><i>Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it is so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time. While you wait for the dough to be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh vegetables, or grating the cheese you’ll put on top. Bake for 15 minutes, garnish with basil (or, let’s be real, more cheese), and enjoy showing off your way-better-than-takeout creation.</i></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <strong>Dough:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon instant yeast </li>
        <li>1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons cold water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Toppings</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Whatever you like :D</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
           <li><strong>Step 1: </strong></li>
           <i>Combine flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a food processor and process until combined, about 3 seconds. With processor running, slowly pour cold water and oil through the food chute and process until dough forms a sticky ball that clears the sides of the bowl, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Lighly oil a work surface and set dough ball on top; knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Shape dough into a tight ball and place in a large bowl greased with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow dough to rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size, 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours.Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Place a pizza stone on the lowest rack in the oven.</i>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong></li>
            <i>Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and gently re-shape into a ball. Coat dough ball lightly with flour and flatten into an 8-inch disk using your fingertips. Using a rolling pin, roll dough into a 12‑inch circle, dusting dough lightly with flour as needed.
                Dust a pizza peel with cornmeal and transfer dough circle on top. Spread marinara sauce on dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. 
                Bake until edges are golden brown and cheese is melted it takes about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and enjoy your delicious pizza!</i>
